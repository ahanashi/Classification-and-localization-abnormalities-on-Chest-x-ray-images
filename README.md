1- Classification-and-localization-abnormalities-on-Chest-x-ray-images.

2-This code proposes two deep learning approaches: multi-classification and object detection models for classifying and localizing abnormalities, including COVID-19, on chest X-rays.

3-The models are trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images, which include the COVID-19 Radiography database for multi-classification , and SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19  for Localization.

4-The ensemble of models, combining multiple object detection models, outperforms single object models in detecting multiple abnormalities in chest X-ray images.
